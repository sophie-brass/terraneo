Extreme-scale mantle convection code for CPU and GPU systems. Originating from the [TerraNeo project](https://terraneo.fau.de).

> ❗️The code is early in development, and thus not yet ready for production. But feel free to try it out!

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mantleconvection/terraneo.git
mkdir terraneo-build
cd terraneo-build
cmake ../terraneo
cd apps/mantlecirculation
make
./mantlecirculation -h
```

## Features

TerraNeo is a matrix-free finite element code written in modern C++ on top of [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos)
mainly focused on massively parallel mantle convection simulations on GPU (and CPU) clusters.

An incomplete list of features
* Runs in massively parallel settings on CPU and GPU systems (via [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos) and MPI)
* Stable discretization of the generalized, compressible Stokes equations (Q1-iso-Q2 / Q1) using spherical wedge finite-elements
* Advection-diffusion discretization using hexahedral [finite volumes with algebraic flux corrected transport (FCT)](#advection-diffusion)
* Plate boundary conditions
* Fully matrix-free
* Krylov methods and geometric multigrid preconditioners (using GCA coarse grid operators)
* Memory efficient unified visualization and checkpoint format (using XDMF)
* Tools (input and output of radial profiles, spherical harmonics)
* Written in modern C++20
